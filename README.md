# Blockstack PKI

This repo contains `js` code to help understand blockstack key derivation and hopefully eventually code examples in multiple languages.

> NOTE: This is experimental software. Use at your own risk!

To run, `npm install` and then `node index.js`

### Open Questions

1. This program generates 24 word mnemonics. How do we generate the 12 word mnemonics?
2. How are app keys derived? Examples.
